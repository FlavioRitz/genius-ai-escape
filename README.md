## 🤔 What in the world is this?

Welcome to Genius AI Escape, the app that'll make your colleagues wonder if you're a secret agent or just really, really unlucky! 

Are you tired of sitting through endless virtual meetings? Do you dream of creative ways to gracefully (or not so gracefully) bow out? Look no further! Genius AI Escape is here to save your sanity, one hilariously implausible excuse at a time.

## 🌟 Features That'll Make You Go "Wow" (or "How?")

- 🎨 A stunningly colorful wheel that's more exciting than your company's annual report
- 🔮 20 expertly crafted excuses that'll leave your coworkers scratching their heads
- 🚀 "Release Me" button - It's like an ejection seat, but for your soul!
- 🤖 AI-powered* excuses that are smarter than your average "my dog ate my homework"

*\*AI in this context stands for "Amusingly Implausible"*

2. Navigate to the project folder (it's like a maze, but easier)
3. Install dependencies:
   ```

## 🎭 Usage (aka How to Artfully Dodge Responsibilities)

1. Wait for a moment in the meeting when everyone is distracted (or when your boss is mid-sentence)
2. Quickly open Genius AI Escape
3. Click "Release Me" and let fate decide your excuse
4. Read the excuse with a straight face (practice in the mirror if needed)
5. Watch as confusion and/or concern spreads across your colleagues' faces
6. Exit the meeting with the confidence of someone who truly believes their "neighbor's peacock is screaming again"

## 🌟 Features That'll Make You Go "Wow" (or "How?")

*\*AI in this context stands for "Amusingly Implausible"*

## 🛠️ How to Escape (I mean, Install)

1. Clone this repository (or download it, we won't judge)
2. Navigate to the project folder (it's like a maze, but easier)
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
   (This might take a while. Go make a sandwich. Or learn a new language. Your choice.)
4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`
6. Spin the wheel and embrace freedom!

## 🎭 Usage (aka How to Artfully Dodge Responsibilities)

1. Wait for a moment in the meeting when everyone is distracted (or when your boss is mid-sentence)
2. Quickly open Genius AI Escape
3. Click "Release Me" and let fate decide your excuse
4. Read the excuse with a straight face (practice in the mirror if needed)
5. Watch as confusion and/or concern spreads across your colleagues' faces
6. Exit the meeting with the confidence of someone who truly believes their "neighbor's peacock is screaming again"
